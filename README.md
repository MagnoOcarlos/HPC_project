Project for increasing performance of a code that uses geometry to simulate the pixelated Earth's surface on a sphere and to calculate a cosmic ray's probability of hitting some pixel in function of the particle's direction emission. In this projeet, we are going to analyze the Hot Spot, optimize our algorithms by choosing a more suitable data struct to avoid conditionals, construct the code profile, as well its benchmarks, and, finally, parallelize it using openmp
